an interface to [phpcs](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/). It is a
fork of the [linter-phpcs](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-phpcs) package
modified to work better for Drupal projects.

### drupalcs Installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `phpcs` is installed on your
system together with the Drupal coding standards.

You can then install this package either from within Atom or by running the
following command:

```
Note: If you do not already have the `linter` package installed it will be installed
for you to provide an interface for this package.

~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu).
